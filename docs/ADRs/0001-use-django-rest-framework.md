# ADR 0001: Use Django REST Framework for API Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a robust framework for building RESTful APIs that can handle our e-commerce platform's requirements for CRUD operations, authentication, and advanced querying capabilities.

## Decision
We will use Django REST Framework (DRF) as our primary API framework.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Built-in support for serialization/deserialization
- Extensive authentication options including JWT
- Powerful viewsets and generic views
- Built-in browsable API interface
- Strong integration with Django ORM
- Rich filtering, pagination, and sorting capabilities

### Negative
- Additional learning curve for developers new to DRF
- Some performance overhead compared to plain Django views
- May require custom solutions for very specific use cases
