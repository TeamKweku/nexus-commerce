# ADR 0005: Role-Based Access Control

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The platform needs to manage different user types (customers, admins) with varying levels of access to API endpoints and resources.

## Decision
We will implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Django's permission system with custom roles.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Fine-grained control over user permissions
- Easy to add new roles and permissions
- Built-in Django admin integration
- Clear separation of concerns

### Negative
- Additional complexity in permission management
- Need to maintain role hierarchies
- Performance impact on API requests requiring permission checks
